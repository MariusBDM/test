    <h2>1. Courtesy on the Road</h2>
    <p>Being courteous on the road means being aware of your surroundings and treating other drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians with respect. Here are key behaviors to follow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yield when necessary</strong>: Even if you have the right of way, yield when it's safer to do so. Always give priority when it's legally required.</li>
        <li><strong>Use signals early</strong>: Signaling your intentions early helps other drivers understand your actions and avoid confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Merge safely</strong>: Always allow room for vehicles to merge, especially in traffic. Blocking merging lanes can lead to accidents and congestion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Avoiding Aggression</h2>
    <p>Driving aggressively can lead to dangerous situations. To avoid aggression:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintain a safe following distance</strong>: Avoid tailgating. Keeping a safe distance allows time to react and avoid collisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay calm and let aggressive drivers pass</strong>: If faced with aggressive driving, stay calm and avoid confrontation. Allow aggressive drivers to pass safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid retaliation</strong>: Never respond to aggressive behavior with equally aggressive actions, such as speeding or cutting off other drivers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Being Patient</h2>
    <p>Patience is key when driving. Avoiding unnecessary risks is vital for staying safe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never rush</strong>: Leave plenty of time to reach your destination to avoid feeling pressured to speed or take risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Yield to pedestrians</strong>: Always stop for pedestrians at crossings, even if they are slow or distracted.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow larger vehicles to maneuver</strong>: Buses and trucks need extra space. Be patient and give them room to turn or stop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Interaction with Vulnerable Road Users</h2>
    <p>Drivers must be cautious around vulnerable road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow down near schools and residential areas</strong>: Be extra vigilant for children and pedestrians crossing the road.</li>
        <li><strong>Give cyclists space</strong>: When overtaking a cyclist, ensure at least 1.5 meters of space.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for motorcyclists</strong>: Motorcycles can be difficult to spot in blind spots. Always check twice before changing lanes.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stay calm</strong>: Avoid eye contact and do not engage with aggressive drivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Let aggressive drivers pass</strong>: Do not challenge aggressive drivers. Safely let them pass to avoid escalation.</li>
        <li><strong>Pull over if necessary</strong>: If threatened, pull over to a safe area and avoid further confrontation.</li>
    </ul>
