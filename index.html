    <h2>Checking for Hazards and Making Turns</h2>
    <p>Before making any move on the road—such as a U-turn—<strong>always check for oncoming traffic</strong> by looking over your shoulder. This simple but crucial step can prevent accidents, particularly at intersections or blind spots where visibility may be limited. Remember to <strong>slow down</strong> when approaching areas with limited visibility, like bends or bridges, and avoid overtaking in risky spots. For more guidance on handling hazards, visit the THINK! Road Safety website.</p>

    <h2>Dealing with Distractions</h2>
    <p><strong>Never use a hand-held phone while driving</strong>. If the light has been green for a while, be prepared for it to turn red. Learn more in our <a href="https://www.fasttheorytest.co.uk/distraction-awareness">Distraction Awareness Guide</a>.</p>

    <h2>Visibility and Safety Precautions</h2>
    <p>Maintaining <strong>clear visibility</strong> is essential for safe driving. If the road ahead isn’t clear, <strong>reduce your speed</strong> to give yourself more reaction time. Ensure that your windshield is free of stickers or objects that could obstruct your view. <strong>Signal early</strong> when changing lanes or making turns to inform other road users of your intentions. For more on maintaining visibility, read our <a href="https://www.fasttheorytest.co.uk/visibility-tips">Visibility Tips</a>.</p>

    <h2>Managing Fatigue and Poor Driving Conditions</h2>
    <p>If you feel tired, <strong>stop and take a break</strong>—fatigue can be fatal. Driving in <strong>wet conditions requires extra caution</strong>—keep both hands steady on the wheel and drive cautiously. When starting off from a stop, always <strong>check your blind spots</strong> by looking over your shoulder, especially when merging into traffic. Stay safe during poor weather conditions with our <a href="https://www.fasttheorytest.co.uk/poor-driving-conditions">guide on driving in poor conditions</a>.</p>

    <h2>Handling Roads with Obstacles</h2>
    <p>When driving on highways or one-way streets, always <strong>look ahead</strong> for potential obstacles, such as windshield pillars that could obstruct your view. These can block your line of sight, making it difficult to see pedestrians or cyclists. If you’re reversing from a driveway, ask someone to help guide you if your visibility is limited.</p>

    <h2>Regular Mirror Checks and Avoiding Blind Spots</h2>
    <p><strong>Checking your mirrors frequently</strong> is crucial, but mirrors don’t cover everything—<strong>blind spots still exist</strong>. For complex maneuvers like reversing in tight spaces or parking, <strong>ask for assistance</strong> to minimize the risk of accidents.</p>

    <h2>Using Satnav and Other Technology Safely</h2>
    <p>While <strong>satnavs</strong> are helpful for navigation, they can also be distracting if not set up properly. Always <strong>set your satnav before starting your journey</strong> to avoid unnecessary distractions while driving. Once on the road, focus on driving and let the satnav guide you. Learn more about safely using tech with our <a href="https://www.fasttheorytest.co.uk/tech-and-driving">Technology and Safe Driving Guide</a>.</p>

    <h2>What you should not do as a driver:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not rely on road markings alone</strong>—always check for oncoming vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Never use a hand-held mobile phone while
		<li><strong>Never use a hand-held mobile phone while driving</strong> except in emergencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not accelerate at long-standing green traffic lights</strong>—prepare for them to change.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid staying too close to large vehicles</strong>—you’ll be in their blind spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not ignore obstructions</strong> like stickers or hanging objects that block your view.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not drive when tired</strong>—take breaks when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Never ignore blind spots</strong>—always check over your shoulder.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not use your satnav or phone while driving</strong>—set it up before you start.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not reverse without ensuring you have clear visibility</strong> or assistance when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not forget to use signals early</strong>—inform other drivers of your intentions in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not overtake in areas with poor visibility</strong>, such as after bends or near junctions.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not get distracted by windscreen pillars</strong>—they can block your view of pedestrians and cyclists.</li>
        <li><strong>Never assume it's safe without checking mirrors</strong>—mirrors can have blind spots.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not assume the road will stay clear after a bend</strong>—visibility and conditions may change rapidly.</li>
    </ul>
